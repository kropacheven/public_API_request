# public_API_request
 FSJS 5 project

 This is an employee directory which randomly displays a list of 12 employees extracted from
 external API every time the page loads. By clicking on any employee card the modal window with
 more detailed information pops up, later it can be closed by pressing 'X' button on right corner.
 Modal window is programmed for switching back and forth between displayed employees by adding
 functionality on 'Prev' and 'Next' buttons. Search bar is added to interactively filter employees.  The header of the page is converted into dark style mode using CSS.

 The app is made by following techniques: 'vanilla' JavaScript, The DOM interaction and manipulation,
 fetch web requests from external API, AJAX, asynchronous programming, regular expressions (regex) for converting data from API.
